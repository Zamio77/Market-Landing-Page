## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Addendum

This was a Udacity project to create a dynamic landing page where the navigation bar updates based on what sections are added to the page. The naviagation page will scroll to the section based on which one is clicked. You can see the completed project [here](https://zamio77.github.io/MarketLangingPage/landing-page/index.html)
